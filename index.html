            <p>Although adjunct faculty successfully negotiated <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/faculty-union-sues-cuny-demands-injunction-rehire-laid-adjuncts">a pay raise</a> CUNY in 2020, the difficulties of teaching as an adjunct professor have not eased in the past two years. Not only did the problems that existed before the pandemic become exacerbated but now there are newer problems to face. </p>
            
            <p> The City University of New York, CUNY, has always relied on its adjunct faculty to educate students in campuses throughout New York City. Adjuncts have been <a href="https://cdha.cuny.edu/collections/show/292">advocating for themselves</a> for as long as they have been hired in CUNY. </p>
            
            <p> This partnership goes back to 1970 when Open Admissions increased diversity and admissions throughout CUNY. By 1974, <a href="https://cdha.cuny.edu/coverage/coverage/show/id/33">1 in 3 teachers</a> at CUNY were adjunct faculty. In <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/media-assets/Fall-2021-Staff-Facts.pdf">2021,</a> CUNY employed 11,453 part-time faculty and 6,889 full-time faculty. </p> 
            <br> 
            <h3 text-align="left">Here are some issues adjunct faculty in CUNY are currently facing</h3> </br>

                <!--link your sources-->
                <p>Even though adjunct pay has increased, it has not increased enough. Many adjuncts teach multiple classes in different colleges to make ends meet and keep their health insurance.</p>

            <p>Many adjuncts are not notified about teaching the next semester until very <a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/cuny-adjuncts-issue-plea-for-respect-and-funding-at-council-hearing">late.</a> gives them less time to prepare for the next class and keeps them worrying about their employment. </p>

            <p>The adjuncts lucky enough to not be fired during the COVID-19 pandemic now struggle with a larger class size. Their classes grew as cap sizes for classes <a href="https://psc-cuny.org/clarion/2020/november/class-size-members-speak/">increased</a> all throughout CUNY.</p>
